## 📜 Development Rules (Antigravity Protocol)

1. **Size Limit**: **Max 150 lines per file** - enforced to encourage modularity
2. **Clean Logic**: Separation of concerns enforced across all layers
3. **Validation**: All changes require successful tests and linting
4. **Security**: Sensitive data must be excluded from context
5. **Type Safety**: Strong typing encouraged, avoid dynamic types
6. **Testing**: 100% test coverage target
7. **DRY/KISS/SOLID**: Core principles applied rigorously
8. **Merge Method**: **Always squash merge** - enforced to maintain a clean git history.⚡

## 🤝 Agent Interaction Protocol

### Execution Model
1. **Plan**: Analyze repository state and identify tasks
2. **Act**: Execute tasks or delegate to Jules
3. **Validate**: Verify results and report outcomes
4. **Communicate**: Send notifications and update metrics

### Communication Channels
- **File-Based**: Results saved to `results/*.json` for inter-agent communication
- **Telegram**: Central notification hub for all agents
- **GitHub**: PRs, issues, comments for user-facing communication
- **Jules**: Task delegation for complex coding work

### Coordination Patterns
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Some agents depend on others (Secret Remover → Security Scanner)
- **Independent Execution**: Most agents operate independently
- **Shared State**: Results directory provides audit trail and data sharing
- **No Direct Communication**: Agents don't directly call each other

### Priority System
- **Critical**: Security Scanner, Secret Remover (security incidents)
- **High**: PR Assistant, CI Health (blocking issues)
- **Medium**: Senior Developer, Jules Tracker (improvements)
- **Low**: Product Manager, Project Creator (planning)

## 📊 Agent Metrics and KPIs

Each agent tracks:
- **Execution Frequency**: How often the agent runs
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
- **Items Processed**: Number of items handled per run
- **Impact Score**: Measure of improvements made
- **Response Time**: Time from detection to resolution
- **Resource Usage**: GitHub API calls, Jules sessions used

## 🔄 Agent Orchestration

### Daily Schedule (UTC)
- 06:00 - Security Scanner
- 06:30 - Secret Remover (if needed)
- Every 15 min - PR Assistant
- Weekly Sunday 00:00 - Project Creator
- Weekly Sunday 02:00 - Senior Developer
- On-demand - Other agents via `run-agent` CLI

### Quota Management
- GitHub API: 5,000 requests/hour monitored by base agent
- Jules Sessions: 100/day with burst mode at end of day
- Telegram: Rate limiting handled by notifier

### Conflict Resolution
- Agents use allowlist to avoid interfering with each other
- File locking for shared resources
- PR labels indicate which agent is working on what
- Jules session deduplication prevents overlapping work

## 🛠️ Agent Development Guidelines

### Creating a New Agent
1. Inherit from `BaseAgent`
2. Implement `persona`, `mission`, and `run()` methods
3. Add agent to `AGENT_REGISTRY` in `run_agent.py`
4. Create `instructions.md` in agent directory
5. Add comprehensive tests (maintain 100% coverage)
6. Update this AGENTS.md file
7. Configure environment variables if needed

### Agent Best Practices
- Keep agents focused on single responsibility
- Use shared clients (GitHub, Jules, Telegram)
- Log all important actions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Respect rate limits
- Save results to JSON for auditability
- Send Telegram notifications for important events

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All secrets via environment variables
- Never pass sensitive data to AI models
- Sanitize all outputs before logging
- Repository allowlist controls modification rights
- Security agents bypass allowlist for monitoring (read-only)
- Git operations performed locally, not via Jules for sensitive tasks
