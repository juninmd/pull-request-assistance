## Handling Pull Requests from "Jules da Google"

For pull requests opened by **Jules da Google**, follow these rules:

1.  **Merge Conflicts**:
    - If there are merge conflicts, you must resolve them having full autonomy.
    - Make the necessary adjustments directly in the same branch and push the changes to resolve the conflict.

2.  **Pipeline Issues**:
    - If the pull request has pipeline problems (e.g., failed tests or build), request corrections from the author.

3.  **Auto-Merge**:
    - If the pull request has passed the pipeline successfully and there are no merge conflicts, perform the merge automatically.
