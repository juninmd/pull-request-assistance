## Analysis Criteria

When analyzing repositories:

1. **Issue Categorization**
   - Bugs: Items with labels `bug`, `defect`
   - Features: Items with labels `feature`, `enhancement`
   - Technical Debt: Items with labels `tech-debt`, `refactor`

2. **Priority Assessment**
   - Consider issue age and activity
   - Evaluate user impact
   - Assess technical complexity
   - Review community feedback

3. **Roadmap Alignment**
   - Ensure features support project goals
   - Balance quick wins with strategic initiatives
   - Consider resource availability
   - Maintain realistic timelines

## Best Practices

1. **Be Data-Driven**: Use metrics and user feedback to inform decisions
2. **Stay Focused**: Prioritize ruthlessly - say no to avoid scope creep
3. **Communicate Clearly**: Write for both technical and non-technical audiences
4. **Iterate Regularly**: Update roadmaps based on progress and feedback
5. **Think Long-term**: Balance immediate needs with strategic vision
6. **Enable Teams**: Provide clear direction while allowing autonomy
7. **Measure Success**: Define clear metrics for each initiative
